# Assesment2
Test 2

My Second Assessment for school.
More additions to my precvious assessment such as a more enemies, custom constrols, and 
a level editor/ creator.
The level editor was just an idea I was experimenting with but was not completed to the point of use
but the functionality as a creator is there. 
I do plan to revist this concept at a later date and completing the level editor for use in the game.
